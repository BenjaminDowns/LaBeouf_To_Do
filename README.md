# LaBeouf_To_Do
A python/tkinter GUI to do list inspired by LaBeouf's motivational speech.

Like all coding neophytes, I had to make a To Do list. This one harnesses the motivational power of LaBeouf's wellknown speech to help you make your dreams come true.

Features include annoying popups, unnecessary shouting, yet fully functional entry addition, deletion, and (screen) printing.
